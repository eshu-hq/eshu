# Cypher Performance Discipline

Use this page before changing hot-path Cypher, graph schema, graph-write
batching, reducer projection, query handlers, materialization jobs, or pinned
graph backend versions. The short mandate lives in the
`cypher-query-rigor` project skill; this page is the durable maintainer
checklist.

Accuracy comes first. A faster query that returns wrong graph truth is a
product failure.

## Mandatory Checks

Every hot-path Cypher change needs both checks before merge.

### 1. Research The Pinned Backend

Neo4j:

- Read the Cypher manual for the pinned major version.
- Check changelogs when planner or syntax behavior matters.
- Confirm recent features such as subqueries, dynamic labels, or vector indexes
  exist in the pinned version before using them.

NornicDB, Eshu's default backend:

- Use the current NornicDB-New checkout named by local config, repo docs, or the
  user. Do not rely on an older sibling checkout unless the run explicitly uses
  it.
- Read the relevant `pkg/cypher/` and `pkg/storage/` source for the production
  query shape.
- Check [NornicDB Pitfalls](nornicdb-pitfalls.md) and
  [NornicDB Tuning](nornicdb-tuning.md).

For both backends, prove any unfamiliar query pattern against the pinned binary
before designing production code around it. Record the backend version or
NornicDB-New commit in the PR evidence.

## 2. Measure The Same Shape Before And After

Unmeasured Cypher in a hot path is a regression risk. Capture before/after
evidence against the same inputs and pinned backend binary.

Preferred proof ladder:

| Shape | Use when | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Focused Go benchmark | Writer code lives under `go/internal/storage/cypher` or a narrow adapter. | `go test -bench=. -benchmem`, with `ops/sec`, `ns/op`, and `B/op`. |
| Compose-stage timing | Query fires only through reducer, projector, or bootstrap flows. | Structured log duration, input size, output count, queue state, backend, and schema state. |
| Manual reproducer | Admin or one-off materialization query. | Wall time, row count, dataset shape, backend version, and schema/index state. |

Record:

- backend and version or image tag
- whether `eshu-bootstrap-data-plane` applied schema first
- input cardinality at each anchor
- indexes and constraints present
- Neo4j `PROFILE` or NornicDB statement summaries when available

Correctness-only Cypher changes still need a same-shape no-regression check.
If a benchmark is not load-bearing, say why in the tracked evidence note.

## CI Evidence Gate

`scripts/verify-performance-evidence.sh` checks changed hot-path Go files,
graph writes, collectors, workers, leases, batching, concurrency primitives,
Compose, Helm, pprof, and NornicDB knobs.

Hot-path changes must update a versioned repo file with one benchmark marker:

- `Performance Evidence:`
- `Benchmark Evidence:`
- `No-Regression Evidence:`

and one observability marker:

- `Observability Evidence:`
- `No-Observability-Change:`

PR text alone is not enough.

Good:

```text
Performance Evidence: focused writer benchmark on NornicDB v1.0.45 with
50,000 File rows moved from 820ms to 310ms; full corpus stayed drained at
896/896 repositories with 0 open queue rows.

Observability Evidence: existing eshu_dp_canonical_phase_duration_seconds and
shared-edge summaries expose phase, row count, and relationship route.
```

Bad:

```text
Performance Evidence: looks faster locally.
Observability Evidence: logs are probably enough.
```

## Backend-Specific Behavior

Prefer backend-neutral Cypher. When behavior diverges, use this order:

1. Restructure the query into a shape both backends handle the same way.
2. Add a narrow dialect seam under `go/internal/storage/cypher/` for schema DDL,
   connection/runtime settings, retry classification, query builders, or
   measured adapters.
3. Patch NornicDB only for an evidence-backed correctness fix, general backend
   performance win, or measured Eshu runtime win.

Do not add backend branches in reducers, query handlers, MCP tools, or
collectors.

## Anti-Patterns

- no baseline
- Neo4j docs cited for NornicDB behavior
- unit tests used as production-cardinality performance proof
- Compose success without phase timing or queue evidence
- index changes without write-amplification discussion
- worker-count or batch-size serialization used as a concurrency fix
