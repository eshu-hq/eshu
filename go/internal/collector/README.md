# Collector

## Purpose

`internal/collector` owns git collection, filesystem-direct collection,
repository discovery, snapshot capture, and parser input shaping for Eshu
indexing runs. It turns source repositories into the inputs required by fact
emission: cloned snapshots, native snapshots, discovery reports, file
selections, and entity metadata. It does not make graph projection or
query-time truth decisions — those belong to the projector, reducer, storage,
and query packages.

## Lifecycle / workflow

`Service.Run` is the poll-and-dispatch loop. Sources that implement
`ObservedSource` can start `SpanCollectorObserve` once they know the poll is a
real collection attempt, which keeps drained or idle polls out of trace export.
When a generation is available, the span covers source collection and durable
commit. When no generation is ready, the service calls `AfterBatchDrained` if
at least one generation was committed since the last drain, then waits
`PollInterval` (1 second in `cmd/ingester`). On receipt of a generation it
calls `Committer.CommitScopeGeneration` with the `facts.Envelope` channel and
records `CollectorObserveDuration`, `FactsEmitted`, `GenerationFactCount`, and
`FactsCommitted`.

`GitSource.Next` manages a per-batch streaming lifecycle. On the first call per
batch it launches `startStream`, which:

1. Calls `Selector.SelectRepositories` to discover the current repository list
   (span: `SpanScopeAssign`).
2. Resolves all paths to absolute form and computes a stable `sourceRunID` via
   `facts.StableID`.
3. Classifies repositories into `smallCh` and `largeCh` by file count via
   `isLargeRepository` (skips `.git`, `node_modules`, `vendor`, `.venv`,
   `__pycache__`).
4. Launches `s.SnapshotWorkers` goroutines (default 8). Workers prefer small
   repos; large repos acquire a `largeSem` semaphore (capacity
   `LargeRepoMaxConcurrent`) before snapshotting so at most N large parses run
   concurrently.
5. A coordinator goroutine closes `s.stream` when all workers finish.

Subsequent `Next` calls read one generation from `s.stream`. When the stream
channel closes, `Next` returns `ok=false` and resets for the next discovery
cycle.

For filesystem sources, `NativeRepositorySelector.SelectRepositories` uses a
manifest under the managed repository cache to avoid reselecting unchanged
workspaces. The manifest hashes the files the collector can actually use:
`.gitignore` and `.eshuignore` rule files are included, while files excluded by
those rules are skipped. This keeps local watch mode from creating new
generations for ignored logs, build outputs, or editor scratch files.

`NativeRepositorySnapshotter.SnapshotRepository` runs five sequential stages
per repository:

1. **Discovery** — `resolveNativeSnapshotFileSet` calls
   `discovery.ResolveRepositoryFileSetsWithStats` with repo-local overrides from
   `.eshu/discovery.json`, `.eshu/vendor-roots.json`, `.gitignore`, and
   `.eshuignore` applied before parsing.
2. **Pre-scan** — `engine.PreScanRepositoryPathsWithWorkers` builds the import
   map concurrently.
3. **Go semantic pre-scan** — `engine.PreScanGoPackageSemanticRoots` builds
   package interface escapes, imported receiver method roots, chained receiver
   roots, generic constraint roots, and package import paths for parser options.
4. **Parse** — `buildParsedRepositoryFiles` parses each file through the
   `parser.Engine` worker pool; each parsed file becomes a `map[string]any`
   entry in `snapshot.FileData` and may carry semantic metadata such as
   dead-code root evidence. `snapshotParserOptions` keeps language-specific
   variable scope close to query needs: Java uses module-level variables so
   method locals do not flood canonical graph projection, while dynamic
   languages that rely on local-variable evidence still parse with
   `VariableScope=all`. Terraform parser buckets are mapped explicitly into
   content entities, including backends, imports, moved blocks, removed blocks,
   checks, and lockfile providers.
5. **Materialize** — `shape.Materialize` turns parsed files into
   `ContentFileMeta` records and `ContentEntitySnapshot` rows. Body strings are
   released after materialization; `streamFacts` re-reads them from disk at emit
   time so snapshot memory is `O(single_file)`.

`buildStreamingGeneration` launches a background goroutine that streams
`facts.Envelope` values through a buffered channel (`factStreamBuffer = 500`).
`AfterBatchDrained` runs only after the service has committed at least one
generation and then observes the source batch drain. Idle polls do not trigger
it.

## Exported surface

- `Service` — poll-and-dispatch loop; wire `Source`, `Committer`,
  `PollInterval`, and optionally `AfterBatchDrained`, `Tracer`,
  `Instruments`, `Logger`
- `Source` — interface: `Next(context.Context) (CollectedGeneration, bool, error)`
- `ObservedSource` — optional source interface that receives a
  `StartObserveFunc` and returns a `CollectorObservation` so real collection
  attempts, not idle polls, can share one `collector.observe` span with commit
- `Committer` — interface: `CommitScopeGeneration(ctx, scope, generation, <-chan facts.Envelope) error`
- `ClaimedCommitter` — optional fence-aware commit interface used by
  `ClaimedService` so claim ownership can be verified in the same transaction
  that persists facts
- `CollectedGeneration` — `Scope`, `Generation`, `Facts` channel, `FactCount`,
  optional `DiscoveryAdvisory`
- `GitSource` — implements `Source`; fields include `Selector`,
  `Snapshotter`, `SnapshotWorkers`, `LargeRepoThreshold`,
  `LargeRepoMaxConcurrent`, `StreamBuffer`
- `NativeRepositorySnapshotter` — implements `RepositorySnapshotter`; fields
  include `Engine`, `Registry`, `DiscoveryOptions`, `SCIP`, `ParseWorkers`
- `RepositorySelector` — interface: `SelectRepositories(context.Context) (SelectionBatch, error)`
- `PriorityRepositorySelector` — tries selectors in order and returns the
  first non-empty batch
- `WebhookTriggerRepositorySelector` — claims queued GitHub, GitLab, and
  Bitbucket webhook triggers, syncs only referenced repositories, fails
  unsupported providers, and returns successful syncs as a targeted batch
- `RepositorySnapshotter` — interface: `SnapshotRepository(context.Context, SelectedRepository) (RepositorySnapshot, error)`
- `SelectionBatch` — `ObservedAt` + `[]SelectedRepository`
- `SelectedRepository` — `RepoPath`, `RemoteURL`, `IsDependency`, `DisplayName`,
  `Language`, `FileTargets`
- `RepositorySnapshot` — `RepoPath`, `RemoteURL`, `FileCount`, `ImportsMap`,
  `FileData`, `ContentFileMetas`, `ContentEntities`, `DiscoveryAdvisory`
- `ContentFileSnapshot`, `ContentFileMeta`, `ContentEntitySnapshot` — portable
  file and entity records; `ContentFileMeta` carries no body string
- `RepoSyncConfig` — all env-driven sync configuration; populated by
  `LoadRepoSyncConfig`
- `LoadRepoSyncConfig(component, getenv)` — parses the repo-sync env contract
- `LoadWebhookTriggerHandoffConfig(defaultOwner, getenv)` — parses the shared
  webhook-trigger handoff env contract used by collector runtimes
- `LoadDiscoveryOptionsFromEnv(getenv)` — parses `ESHU_DISCOVERY_IGNORED_PATH_GLOBS`
  and `ESHU_DISCOVERY_PRESERVED_PATH_GLOBS`
- `LoadSnapshotSCIPConfig(getenv)` — parses the SCIP env contract
- `SnapshotSCIPConfig` — `Enabled`, `Languages`, `Indexer`, `Parser`
- `DiscoveryAdvisoryReport` — operator-facing JSON summary of discovery and
  materialization shape per snapshot run
- `RegistryFailure` — bounded registry collector error type that carries
  `FailureClass` and `FailureDetails` for workflow status without exposing
  private registry hosts, repositories, packages, tags, digests, accounts,
  paths, or credential references
- `RegistryHTTPFailure` and `RegistryTransportFailure` — helpers used by
  registry runtimes to classify auth denied, not found, rate limited,
  retryable, canceled, and terminal registry failures
- `ClaimedService` — wraps `Service` with a `ClaimControlStore` for
  workflow-coordinator-gated collection
- `FactsFromSlice` — test helper: builds a `CollectedGeneration` from a
  pre-built `[]facts.Envelope` slice
- `terraformstate` subpackage — exact Terraform-state source readers and
  streaming parser primitives that emit redacted Terraform-state facts
- `tfstateruntime` subpackage — claim-aware Terraform-state runtime adapter that
  resolves exact candidates, opens the matching state source, and emits a
  fenced collected generation for `ClaimedService`
- `packageregistry` subpackage — package-registry identity normalization,
  runtime target contracts, metadata parsing, claim runtime, and
  reported-confidence package fact-envelope construction for the
  `package_registry` collector family
- `ociregistry` subpackage — OCI registry identity, provider adapters,
  runtime scan orchestration, and reported-confidence container image facts

  `language_parse_summary` rows with file count and parse duration totals per
  language), `collector snapshot completed`,
  `collector commit succeeded / failed`, `collector stream completed / failed`,
  `large repository queued`, `large repo semaphore acquired / released`

## Operational notes

- `ESHU_SNAPSHOT_WORKERS` (default `min(NumCPU,8)`) controls concurrent
  per-repo snapshotting. Raising this value beyond CPU capacity increases
  context-switching without reducing wall time.
- `ESHU_LARGE_REPO_FILE_THRESHOLD` (default `1000`) classifies repositories for
  the large-repo semaphore. The classification is a fast pre-scan that exits
  early once the threshold is exceeded.
- Repo-local `.eshu/discovery.json` and `.eshu/vendor-roots.json` override default
  discovery options before the operator-level `ESHU_DISCOVERY_IGNORED_PATH_GLOBS`
  overlay is applied.
- Filesystem manifest fingerprints include `.gitignore` and `.eshuignore` rule
  files but exclude paths filtered by those rules. Changing an ignore rule
  reselects the repository; changing only ignored output does not.
- Two-phase streaming: `ContentFileMeta` carries no body; `streamFacts`
  re-reads file bodies from disk at emit time. The OS page cache keeps re-reads
  fast. Do not change this design to in-memory bodies without accounting for
  `O(repo_size)` memory growth on large repositories.
- Performance Evidence: On 2026-05-15, pprof from the remote full-corpus
  Compose run showed bootstrap startup CPU in filesystem repository copy and
  ignore matching before graph projection began. A focused local benchmark for
  literal ignore patterns improved from 2.35-2.44 us/op, 656 B/op, and 10
  allocs/op at `4d31617` to 1.11-1.13 us/op, 96 B/op, and 1 alloc/op after
  routing non-glob `.gitignore` and `.eshuignore` rules through literal
  matching.
- Observability Evidence: The existing `collector snapshot stage completed`
  logs, `SpanScopeAssign`, `SpanCollectorStream`, and pprof profiles expose the
  selector/copy window separately from per-repository discovery, pre-scan,
  parse, materialize, commit, and projection stages.
- Parser variable scope is part of performance and truth. Java defaults to
  module-level variables during native snapshots because dead-code candidates
  and Java call inference do not need every method-local declaration as a
  canonical `Variable` node. Keep JS/TS/Python local-variable coverage intact
  unless their query contracts change.
- Terraform-state ingestion currently uses explicit sources and Git-observed
  backend facts. The #140 target design adds repo-local `.tfstate` candidates
  as advisory metadata, but those candidates must not route raw state through
  Git content persistence or parse state as normal repository content.
- Terraform-state claim processing records `eshu_dp_tfstate_claim_wait_seconds`
  and uses `tfstate.collector.claim.process` around the claimed work boundary.
- `AfterBatchDrained` is a batch boundary hook, not a timer callback. Use it for
  work that should follow committed collection, and keep idle-poll behavior in
  `Source.Next` or the coordinator layer.

## Extension points

- `RepositorySelector` — replace `NativeRepositorySelector` with any
  implementation to change how repositories are discovered
- `PriorityRepositorySelector` — compose a high-priority selector, such as
  webhook-triggered refresh, ahead of scheduled polling
- `RepositorySnapshotter` — replace `NativeRepositorySnapshotter` with any
  implementation to change how repositories are snapshotted
- `Source` / `Committer` — both are interfaces; test implementations substitute
  recording or controlled-error variants
- `SnapshotSCIPConfig.Indexer` and `.Parser` — injectable seams for testing SCIP
  paths without external binaries

## Gotchas / invariants

- `GitSource.startStream` performs synchronous discovery before launching
  snapshot workers. A slow `Selector.SelectRepositories` (e.g. slow GitHub API
  response) blocks the entire stream start.
- Large-repo semaphore is acquired inside the worker select loop, not inside
  `processRepo`. This means a worker never blocks waiting for the semaphore while
  small repos are available (`git_source.go:419-431`).
- `streamErr` is written by the coordinator goroutine and read by `Next` only
  after the stream channel closes. The happens-before guarantee is that
  `close(s.stream)` happens-before the receive in `Next` that returns
  `ok=false`.
- Absolute paths: `resolveRepositories` calls `filepath.Abs` on every selected
  repo path before building the `sourceRunID` hash. Do not pass relative paths
  to `NativeRepositorySnapshotter.SnapshotRepository` — it calls
  `filepath.Abs` again but the fact IDs would differ.
- Filesystem manifests must stay aligned with copy/direct snapshot filtering.
  If `fingerprintTree` starts hashing ignored generated files, local watch mode
  can keep publishing newer generations and supersede projector work before the
  graph settles.
- Webhook trigger selection is a wake-up path only. It may prioritize a GitHub,
  GitLab, or Bitbucket repo sync, but the fetched default branch still decides
  freshness. Provider-scoped repository IDs select the right clone host; GitHub
  token and GitHub App auth remain GitHub-specific, while SSH is the
  provider-neutral private-repo path.
