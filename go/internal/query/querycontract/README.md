# Query contracts

## Purpose

`querycontract` holds the stable types and small helpers that query families
need without depending on the root `query` package.

## Ownership boundary

This package owns query profiles, truth and error envelopes, freshness causes,
HTTP response helpers, the shared capability registry, and the graph/content
read ports. It does not own routes, handler orchestration, graph queries, or
Postgres implementations. Those remain in the root query package or a family
package.

## Exported surface

The exported surface is described in [doc.go](doc.go). Root `query` aliases the
types and wraps the functions so existing imports keep their current API.

## Dependencies

The package uses only the Go standard library. `GraphQuery` and `ContentStore`
are consumer-owned ports; concrete adapters remain outside this leaf package.

## Telemetry

This package emits no metrics, spans, or logs. Handlers and storage adapters
retain their existing telemetry.

No-Observability-Change: moving these contracts does not change the handler or
adapter call paths that emit telemetry.

## Gotchas / invariants

Capability registration is ordered and rejects duplicate initialization in the
contract tests. The low-level compatibility setter remains last-write-wins for
existing root-package tests. Unknown capabilities still panic when building a
truth envelope, and an unknown required profile still defaults to
`local_full_stack`.

`K8sSelectCandidate` carries selector presence separately from selector value.
Family code must preserve absent, present-empty, and present-nonempty states
when converting it into matcher input.

No-Regression Evidence: `go test ./internal/query/... -count=1` passed after the
final boundary edit. During the scratch proof, the complete query-playbook
family and its four test files moved under `internal/query/playbook`; its route,
catalog-order, resolver, recursive root-query tests passed, followed by
`go build ./...` and `go vet ./...`, both at exit 0. The family move was then
reverted, leaving only this contract boundary. Mutation runs proved the unknown-
capability panic test fails if the root truth wrapper stops delegating and the
selector tri-state test fails if candidate presence is dropped.

## Verification

From `go/`, run `go test ./internal/query/... -count=1`, `go build ./...`, and
`go vet ./...`. From the repository root, run
`scripts/verify-package-docs.sh` and the B-7 golden-corpus proof selected by
the parent package instructions.
