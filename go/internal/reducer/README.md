# internal/reducer

`internal/reducer` owns cross-domain materialization, queued repair, and
shared projection that runs after source-local facts have been committed by
the projector. It is the authoritative owner of canonical graph truth for
cross-source and cross-scope domains.

Reducer changes carry the highest correctness risk in the codebase. Wrong
graph truth, query truth, or deployment truth is a product failure. Track the
full path — raw evidence → admitted candidate → projected row → graph write →
query surface — before changing ordering, admission, retries, or
backend-specific behavior. See CLAUDE.md "Correlation Truth Gates".

## Domain catalog

All twelve reducer domains are declared in `domain.go` and registered via
`NewDefaultRuntime` / `NewDefaultRegistry` in `defaults.go`. Each domain has an
`OwnershipShape` enforcing cross-source, cross-scope, and canonical-write
requirements.

| Domain constant | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| `DomainWorkloadIdentity` | Resolve canonical workload identity across sources |
| `DomainDeployableUnitCorrelation` | Correlate cross-source deployable-unit evidence before workload admission |
| `DomainCloudAssetResolution` | Resolve canonical cloud asset identity across sources |
| `DomainDeploymentMapping` | Materialize platform bindings across sources |
| `DomainDataLineage` | Resolve lineage across sources and scopes |
| `DomainOwnership` | Resolve ownership and responsibility records |
| `DomainGovernance` | Resolve governance and policy attribution |
| `DomainWorkloadMaterialization` | Materialize canonical workload graph nodes |
| `DomainCodeCallMaterialization` | Materialize canonical code-call edges |
| `DomainSemanticEntityMaterialization` | Materialize Annotation, Typedef, TypeAlias, Component semantic nodes |
| `DomainSQLRelationshipMaterialization` | Materialize canonical SQL relationship edges |
| `DomainInheritanceMaterialization` | Materialize inheritance, override, and alias edges |

## Intent lifecycle

`Intent` (declared in `intent.go:104`) carries the durable queue contract.
States: `pending` → `claimed` → `running` → `succeeded` / `failed`.

- `IntentStatusPending`, `IntentStatusClaimed`, `IntentStatusRunning`,
  `IntentStatusSucceeded`, `IntentStatusFailed` — `intent.go:51–61`.
- `ResultStatusSucceeded`, `ResultStatusFailed`, `ResultStatusSuperseded` —
  `intent.go:69–75`.
- `ResultStatusSuperseded` short-circuits execution when
  `GenerationCheck` confirms a newer generation is active for the scope.

## Queue claim / execute / ack loop

`Service` (declared in `service.go:54`) coordinates the main loop:

- **Sequential** (`Workers <= 1`): `Claim` → `executeWithTelemetry` →
  `Ack` or `Fail` in order.
- **Concurrent** (`Workers > 1`): N goroutines compete. When `WorkSource`
  implements `BatchWorkSource` and `WorkSink` implements `BatchWorkSink`,
  the batch path reduces Postgres round-trips.
- **Heartbeat**: `startHeartbeat` (`service.go:409`) spawns a goroutine
  that calls `Heartbeat` at `HeartbeatInterval`; the heartbeat is stopped
  before `Ack` or `Fail` to avoid lease extension after the transaction
  commits.

`Service.Run` also starts `SharedProjectionRunner`, `CodeCallProjectionRunner`,
`RepoDependencyProjectionRunner`, and `GraphProjectionPhaseRepairer` as
concurrent goroutines. Any runner error cancels the shared context.

## Graph projection phase coordination

`graph_projection_phase_state` is the durable readiness coordination table.
Phases and keyspaces are declared in `graph_projection_phase.go`.

Key phases:

| Phase constant | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `GraphProjectionPhaseCanonicalNodesCommitted` | Projector canonical node writes committed |
| `GraphProjectionPhaseSemanticNodesCommitted` | Semantic entity reducer writes committed |
| `GraphProjectionPhaseDeployableUnitCorrelation` | Deployable-unit correlation pass finished |
| `GraphProjectionPhaseDeploymentMapping` | `deployment_mapping` domain finished one bounded slice |
| `GraphProjectionPhaseWorkloadMaterialization` | `workload_materialization` domain finished |
| `GraphProjectionPhaseCrossSourceAnchorReady` | Reserved for DSL cross-source anchor publication |

`GraphProjectionPhasePublisher` (interface at `graph_projection_phase.go:117`)
is the only write path for phase rows. Use `publishIntentGraphPhase`
(`graph_projection_phase_publish.go`) inside handlers rather than calling the
publisher directly.

`GraphProjectionPhaseRepairQueue` (`graph_projection_phase_repair.go:36`) and
`GraphProjectionPhaseRepairer` (`graph_projection_phase_repair_runner.go:58`)
handle the case where a graph write commits but the subsequent phase
publication fails; the repairer retries exact rows durably.

## Code-call materialization

`ExtractCodeCallRows` turns parser `function_calls` and SCIP call facts into
canonical `CALLS` edges. Native parser calls resolve in this order: same-file
symbols, Go same-directory symbols, repository-unique symbols, then imported
cross-file symbols when the prescan import map proves the target file. For
JavaScript-family files, import resolution also honors parser-proven namespace
aliases, tsconfig `baseUrl` `resolved_source` metadata, and one bounded hop
through static relative re-export barrels. Constructor calls and local receiver
type metadata let `new Type()` and `value.method()` resolve to class and method
entities when parser evidence proves the local type. For package entrypoint,
package bin, and package export files, top-level calls may use the repository
scoped `File.uid` as the caller so executable module bodies can make `main()`,
constructor, and member calls reachable without treating every library module as
a root. The Go same-directory step applies to functions and type entities from
`structs` and `interfaces`; command packages commonly reuse local helper names
such as `wireAPI` in sibling `cmd/*` directories, so repo-wide bare-name
resolution must stay ambiguous in that case.

Parser metadata rows with `call_kind=go.composite_literal_type_reference` or
`call_kind=typescript.type_reference` materialize as deduplicated `REFERENCES`
edges. They prove type-reference roots for dead-code classification, but must
not materialize as `CALLS` because that would make graph truth claim that type
literals invoke types.

SCIP edges bypass the heuristic resolver when both caller and callee locations
map to known entities. Keep the native and SCIP paths idempotent: duplicate
facts for the same caller, callee, and reference line must collapse to one
intent row before graph writes.

## Shared projection runner

`SharedProjectionRunner` (`shared_projection_runner.go:95`) iterates all
shared-projection domains and all partitions each cycle, calling
`ProcessPartitionOnce` for each domain/partition pair. Domains processed:
`platform_infra`, `workload_dependency`, `inheritance_edges`,
`sql_relationships`.

The runner uses exponential back-off (doubling each empty cycle, capped at
`5s`) to avoid sustained high-frequency polling during idle periods. When
intents are blocked on a readiness phase (`BlockedReadiness > 0`), it
re-polls at the base interval without backing off.

Configuration via `LoadSharedProjectionConfig` reads
ESHU_SHARED_PROJECTION_* env vars; see `cmd/reducer/README.md`.

## Facts-First Bootstrap Ordering

The bootstrap pipeline in `go/cmd/bootstrap-index/main.go` enforces a
multi-pass ordering that the reducer must honor:

```text
Phase 1 — Collection + First-Pass Reduction
  Projector drains and emits canonical nodes. deployment_mapping can remain
  pending because resolved_relationships do not yet exist.

Phase 2 — Backfill
  BackfillAllRelationshipEvidence() (bootstrap-index/main.go:236)
  populates relationship_evidence_facts and publishes readiness rows.

Phase 3 — Deployment Mapping Reopen
  ReopenDeploymentMappingWorkItems() (bootstrap-index/main.go:273)
  reopens deployment_mapping so the reducer can create resolved_relationships.

Phase 4 — Second-Pass Consumers
  Any domain consuming resolved_relationships must have a re-trigger
  mechanism after Phase 3.
```

**Critical rule**: any reducer domain or sub-package that consumes
`resolved_relationships` must have a post-Phase-3 reopen or re-trigger
mechanism. Adding a new consumer without that mechanism creates an E2E-only
bug that is invisible in unit and integration tests.

Log phase attributes: `telemetry.PhaseReduction` (main loop),
`telemetry.PhaseShared` (shared projection and repair runner).

## Gotchas / invariants

- **All reducer domains must be cross-source, cross-scope, and
  canonical-write** — enforced by `OwnershipShape.Validate` at
  registration (`registry.go:22–33`).
- **Projection must be idempotent** — queue retries, duplicate claims, and
  partial graph writes must converge on the same truth.
- **Generation supersession** — `Runtime.execute` calls `GenerationCheck`
  before dispatching to a handler; stale intents return
  `ResultStatusSuperseded` without touching the graph.
- **`deployment_mapping` requires post-Phase-3 reopen** — the domain
  cannot produce `resolved_relationships` until after
  ReopenDeploymentMappingWorkItems runs in the bootstrap pipeline
  (bootstrap-index/main.go:273).
- **Phase publications and graph writes are not atomic** — if a graph write
  commits but the subsequent `PublishGraphProjectionPhases` call fails, the
  `GraphProjectionPhaseRepairQueue` captures the publication for retry by
  `GraphProjectionPhaseRepairer`. Do not remove the repair queue without
  understanding this failure mode.
- **Edge domain readiness gates** — shared projection domains
  `code_calls`, `sql_relationships`, and `inheritance_edges` gate on
  `canonical_nodes_committed` or `semantic_nodes_committed` being present
  before writing edges (`shared_projection.go:91–99`).
- **Bare code-call names are scoped before they are broadened** — same-file
  resolution wins first. Go then allows a same-directory match before the
  repository-unique fallback; if another package has the same bare name, do
  not create a repo-wide edge.
- **JavaScript-family top-level calls need file-root evidence** — only
  package entrypoint, package bin, and package export files can use the
  repo-scoped `File.uid` caller for top-level calls. Do not promote arbitrary
  module-body calls to roots.
- **`BuildSharedProjectionIntent` produces a stable SHA256 ID** —
  changing any of the identity fields breaks idempotency for in-flight
  intents (`shared_projection.go:59–66`).
