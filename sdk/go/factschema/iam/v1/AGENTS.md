# AWS IAM Fact Payloads Agent Rules

This directory is part of the public
`github.com/eshu-hq/eshu/sdk/go/factschema` Go module. It holds the
schema-version-1 typed payload structs for the AWS IAM fact family:
`Permission`, `ResourcePolicyPermission`, and `Principal`. It must remain
independent from Eshu internals.

## Required Checks

- Read the root `AGENTS.md`, the module `AGENTS.md`, and
  `docs/internal/agent-guide.md` before edits.
- Do not import `github.com/eshu-hq/eshu/go/internal/...`. Keep the module
  standalone.
- After changing any payload struct's fields, run `go generate ./...` from
  the module root and commit the regenerated schema under `../../schema/`.
- Run `go test ./... -count=1` from the module root (`sdk/go/factschema`),
  `gofmt` on changed Go files, and `git diff --check` from the repo root.

## Contract Rules

- A field is required exactly when its json tag carries no `omitempty`; by the
  flat-struct convention required fields are also non-pointer, and optional
  fields are pointers or slices, carrying `omitempty`. Both the schema
  generator (`../../internal/schemagen`) and the decode seam's required-field
  check (`../../decode.go`) derive that set reflectively from the struct's own
  tags via `../../fields.go`, so there is no hand-maintained key list to keep
  in sync. `TestDerivedKeySetsMatchGeneratedSchemas` locks the two derivations
  to the generated schema, `TestPayloadStructShapeConvention` enforces the
  flat-struct convention, and `TestSchemasHaveNoDrift` keeps every checked-in
  schema in lockstep with its struct.
- `ClassificationInputInvalid` is the parent `factschema` package's own
  constant (`decode.go`). A reducer handler receiving it must dead-letter the
  fact rather than proceed with a zero-value struct.
- Removing, renaming, or narrowing a field is a major schema bump and needs a
  conversion shim in the parent package's decode seam (`decodeLatestMajor` in
  `../../decode.go`), not a silent edit here.
- No struct in this package carries an `Attributes` pass-through. Every IAM
  policy statement field this package models is a named, typed field — do
  not add an untyped catch-all map here; it would contradict the
  fully-typed contract this package documents (see `README.md`). If a new
  IAM payload shape genuinely needs a pass-through, that is a design
  discussion, not a local edit.
- No struct here carries the raw policy JSON body or a condition value. Keep
  it that way — `HasConditions` / similar flags are derived booleans only.
- This package defines three fact kinds (`aws_iam_permission`,
  `aws_resource_policy_permission`, `aws_iam_principal`). Adding a fourth
  kind or a `v2` major is follow-on epic work, not a casual edit.
